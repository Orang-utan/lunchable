        <div>
          Lunchable is a way for you to eat virtually with friends and catch up
          with them, just like how you used to eat with friends on campus and
          have great convos over meals.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          We built lunchable because we realized that many of us were drifting
          apart from friends over time, simply because we aren't eating together
          like we used to!
